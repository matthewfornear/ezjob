Project: Job Application Automation Bot
Status: In Development
Last Updated: 2024-05-10

Current Features:
1. Form Detection System
   - Object detection model (YOLOv5) for detecting form elements with bounding boxes
   - Label detection and field-label relationship mapping
   - Support for 80+ different form element types and labels
   - Real-time form element localization and classification

2. Data Collection & Annotation
   - Full-page screenshot capture (Selenium)
   - Training data collection tool
   - Labeled dataset creation using bounding boxes
   - Annotation with LabelImg (cloned repository, YOLO format)
   - Comprehensive class definitions for job application forms

3. Machine Learning Pipeline
   - YOLOv5-based object detection model
   - PyTorch backend
   - Transfer learning implementation
   - Real-time inference capabilities

4. Automation (Optional)
   - Vision-based form filling using detected elements
   - Automation logic in src/core/job_applicator.py

Tech Stack:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.2.0
- YOLOv5 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- NumPy
- Selenium
- LabelImg (cloned repository)
- pyautogui
- VS Code
- Git
- Windows 10/11

Current Tasks:
1. Data Collection
   - [x] Full-page screenshot script (Selenium)
   - [x] Data organization (images/labels)
   - [x] Collect diverse form screenshots
2. Annotation
   - [x] LabelImg repository cloned and configured
   - [x] Classes.txt created with comprehensive UI elements
   - [x] Batch file created for easy LabelImg startup
   - [ ] Annotate screenshots in YOLO format
3. Model Training
   - [x] YOLOv5 repo setup
   - [x] Prepare data.yaml
   - [ ] Train model on annotated data
4. Automation
   - [ ] Integrate detection with JobApplicator (optional)
   - [ ] Test end-to-end automation (optional)

Next Steps:
1. Complete annotation of screenshots using LabelImg
2. Train YOLOv5 model
3. (Optional) Integrate and test automation

Dependencies:
- torch==2.2.0
- torchvision
- yolov5
- opencv-python
- Pillow
- numpy
- labelImg (cloned repository)
- selenium
- pyautogui
- python-dotenv
- logging
- datetime

Immediate Next Action:
1. Complete annotation of screenshots using LabelImg
2. Train YOLOv5 model
3. (Optional) Use JobApplicator for automation

Project Progress:
- Environment Setup: 100%
- Data Collection: 90%
- Annotation Setup: 80%
- Model Training: 20%
- Automation: 10%
- Documentation: 60%

Overall Project Progress: 45%

Note: The project has transitioned from a custom annotation tool to using the LabelImg repository for better reliability and features. The annotation process is now streamlined with a batch file for easy startup and proper directory configuration.
