Next Steps (Atomic Tasks):

1. Data Collection Phase
   a. Create data collection directory:
      mkdir -p data/raw data/processed data/labels
   
   b. Run initial data collection:
      python src/ml/data/collect_form_data.py --html-path data/training_forms/job_application.html --num-samples 100 --data-dir data
      - This will collect 100 game state samples (screenshots of the game window and associated metadata)
      - After collection, you must manually label each screenshot (e.g., mark/classify enemies, items, NPCs, UI elements, etc.)
      - Save the labels in data/labels/

2. Vision Model Training
   a. After collecting and labeling initial data:
      python src/ml/train.py --num-epochs 10 --batch-size 32 --data-dir data
      - This will train the vision model to recognize and classify game elements from screenshots
      - Model will be saved in models/vision/
      - Training metrics will be logged

3. RL Environment Setup
   a. Define game states and actions:
      - Edit src/ml/models/rl_model.py
      - Define state space
      - Define action space
      - Implement reward function

4. RL Model Training
   a. After vision model is trained:
      python src/ml/train_rl.py --total-timesteps 10000
      - This will train the RL model
      - Model will be saved in models/rl/
      - Training metrics will be logged

5. Testing and Validation
   a. Test vision model:
      python src/ml/train.py --evaluate
   b. Test RL model:
      python src/ml/train_rl.py --evaluate

6. Integration Testing
   a. Run the bot with trained models:
      python src/run_bot.py --vision-model models/vision/latest.pt --rl-model models/rl/latest.zip

Current Progress:
- Environment Setup: 100%
- Core Infrastructure: 80%
- Vision System: 40%
- RL System: 30%
- Game Integration: 20%
- Testing and Safety: 10%
- Documentation: 15%

Overall Project Progress: 35%

Immediate Next Action:
1. Start data collection by running:
   python src/ml/data/collect_form_data.py --html-path data/training_forms/job_application.html --num-samples 100 --data-dir data
   - This will capture 100 screenshots of the game window and store them in data/raw/ with metadata
2. Manually label the collected data (identify/classify game elements in each screenshot and save labels in data/labels/)
3. Begin vision model training

Note: Each step should be completed and validated before moving to the next step. The data collection and labeling phase is crucial for the success of the vision model, which in turn is essential for the RL model's performance.
